Yuehao is a PhD student at [JKU](https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-angewandte-statistik/) under supervision of [Univ.-Prof. Mag. Dr. Andreas Futschik](https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-angewandte-statistik/ueber-uns/team/univ-prof-mag-dr-andreas-futschik/) and [Dr Ritabrata Dutta](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/). After completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics at UIUC, I went on to complete my Master of Science degree in Statistics at the University of Warwick before beginning my doctoral studies. Dr. Ritabrata Dutta served as the advisor for my master's thesis. I believe we could use the power of statistics to tackle a real-world problem. 

Research interest: Bayesian Statistics and Biostatistics
